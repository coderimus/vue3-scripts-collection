# Vue3 Scripts Collection
👋 Hey there!
Welcome to my collection of practical Vue 3 scripts. This repository started as a personal playground when I was first
diving into the world of Vue. As I explored its features and tackled real-world challenges, I decided to document my journey
by creating reusable solutions, practical examples, and even code snippets inspired by the official documentation.
I've crafted this repository to be a valuable resource for Vue.js developers of all levels, whether you're a seasoned
pro or just beginning your adventure.

## Why Vue 3?
Vue 3 is my go-to JavaScript framework for crafting dynamic and performant user interfaces. It's incredibly approachable,
boasts comprehensive documentation, and has a vibrant community always willing to lend a hand.
With its improved performance, Composition API, and focus on developer experience,
Vue 3 helps me build rock-solid applications.

## Repository Structure
The repository is presently organised as a flat list of scripts, but as the collection expands,
it will be structured into thematic categories for easier navigation.
